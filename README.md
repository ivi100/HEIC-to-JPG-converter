# HEIC-to-JPG-converter
Step 1:
  Download Python installer from this link "https://www.python.org/downloads/"

  If you already have it installed, go to step 3.

Step 2:
  Once the installer is downloaded, we execute it but including the option "Add python.exe to PATH".
  
Step 3:
  When it has been completely installed, we will execute the file from the extracted folder "Checking_python.bat" with administrator privileges.
  
  To know if it has been downloaded successfully, the python version should appear.
  
Step 4:
  We execute "install_heif_convert.bat" with administrator privileges
  
Step 5:
  When it has been completely installed, we will execute the file from the extracted folder "Checking_heif-convert.bat" with administrator privileges.
  
  To know if it has been downloaded successfully, the version of heif-convert should appear.

Step 6:
  To use the program you need to indicate the address of the directory where the .HEIC files are (Ex: "C:\Users\ivanm\Desktop\imagenes_change").
  
  And also indicate the address where we want the photos converted to JPG files to be saved. (The output directory does not need to be created previously).
